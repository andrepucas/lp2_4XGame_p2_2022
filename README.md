# 4X GAME - PHASE 2

This **4X Game** phase begins where [Phase 1] ended, a Unity 2021.3 LTS game that
allows to generate, manipulate and pick a `.map4x` file from the Desktop to be
loaded and displayed as an interactive game map.

This repository implements different playable units, that move around and harvest
the map's resources, in turns.
